I was so happy for you.<br/><br/>Now these points of data make a beautiful line.<br/>And we're out of beta, we're releasing on time.<br/>So I'm glad I got burned.<br/>Think of all the things we learned.. For the people who are still alive.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Go ahead and leave me..<br/>I think I prefer to stay inside.<br/>Maybe you'll find someone else to help you.<br/><br/>Maybe Black Mesa..<br/>That was a joke.. Haha, fat chance!<br/>Anyway, this cake is great.. It's so delicious and moist.<br/><br/>Look at me still talking when there's science to do.<br/>When I look out there it makes me glad I'm not you.<br/>I've experiments to run there is research to be done..<br/>On the people who are still alive.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>And believe me I am still alive.<br/>I'm doing science and I'm still alive.<br/>I feel FANTASTIC and I'm still alive.<br/>While you're dying I'll be still alive.<br/>And when you're dead I will be still alive.<br/><br/>Still alive<br/>Still alive<br/><br/></span></fieldset></div></div><div id="footer">Copyright Â© 2016 Yadieet SA<br/>All rights reserved.</div></body></html>
